Pseudocode for Project 1: "The pesky tourist"

1) Set up the IDE with appropriate BGI library.
2) Make sure project has pictures available 

--Now the code

3)Create a window that will get loaded all of the images that you will use for your project	, call it 'CurrentImage'
4)Create a second window that will display the final resulting image of your project call it'FinalImage'
5)Create a function that will load each image, call it'loadImage':
	The function will loop through all the images,
	Set the images starting with the first, as long as there are images left.
	Make each image your current image that you will work on using the BGI built in function "setcurrentwindow".
	
6) Now that Your image is loaded, create another function to get the pixel value,callit 'getPixel':
	For each images that is loaded('CurrentImage'), you will call this function.
	This function will compare the RGB pixel values for each 9 images that get loaded into the 'loadImage' function.
	For every pixel of the image, place the 'Red' pixel value into an integer array.
								  place the 'Green' pixel value into an integer array.
								  place the 'Blue' pixel value into an integer array. 

	Sort the array of RGB values from lowest to higest.
	Pick out the median value of each Red blue green value, and store them into variables
	RedPixel, BluePixel, GreenPixel.
	After that call the putpixel built in function for that current pixel of your 'FinalImage'
	
	Repeat this process until you have gone through every pixel.
